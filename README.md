# Processing Projects
A collection of projects made in [Processing](https://www.processing.org/).  
Everything is to varying degrees completely useless and/or not finished.

## Projects
* **Clock** - An analogue clock. All hours are dots except the current one.
* **Colour Change** - New random colour every second.
* **Colour Change Cloud** - There's a comment saying "bits of circles or curves forming a cloud on the screen changing in colour from left to right". I think this was a bad attempt at particles.
* **Colour Lines Circle** - Fills the screen with a random colour by drawing lines in a circular manor. When the screen has been filled a new colour starts filling it.
* **Counter-Feet** - Based on the game from Septimus Heap. Not finished, barely started.
* **Cube** - Saves screenshots of a rotating cube. Used to make [this GIF](https://diefonk-wip.tumblr.com/post/151394622083/a-person-thinking-a-cube-but-speaking-a-square-i).
* **Greyscale Lines** - Fills the screen with lines of varying thickness and shades of grey.
* **Ladybug** - Fills the screen with a random colour every 20 seconds, and then spends the next 20 seconds drawing dots in a different random colour in random positions.
* **Line Graphs** - Every minute a new line graph is randomly generated. Press the S key to save the current graph as PNG in the program directory.
* **Minute Art** - Picks a random palette from a set of palettes every minute, and fills the screen with a random colour from that palette. Then draws random lines with the other colours from that palette for the next minute.
* **New Sound Colour** - Analyzes audio from the computers input and sets the entire screen to a colour based on the audio.
* **Second Art** - Fills the screen with as many random shapes with random colours as it can in one second and then starts over.
* **Smooth Colour Change** - Sets the whole screen to a random colour, and then every second a new random colour is picked and there's a smooth transition for one second.
* **Sound Colour** - Fades between random colours at the same time as it analyzes audio from the computers input and alters the colours based on the audio.
* **Sound Light** - Analyzes audio from the computers input and sets the entire screen to a greyscale colour based on the audio.
